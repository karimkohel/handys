# handys
control your system volume with hand gestures, this will not be helpful to you in any way as it is a fun project I'm doing while on vacation to keep my hands busy (you see what i did there)

## Latest
the project started as a dummy project for me to work on something while I'm on vacation, it morphed into a library for hand detection that would be best suited for my needs down the line of projects I'm planning so it's probable that it would not suit your special needs but feel free to try it.

## How to try it
just clone the repo and install requirements, you'll be able to use the handtracking.py module by importing the file because I'm too lazy to push the module to PYPI.
